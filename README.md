# Evolution-Simulated
Simulating evolution of creatures in JavaScript
___

This project is an attempt at simulating evolution at an individual creature level. <br>
Maybe later I will attempt to make a version that works on a cellular level? <br>

## The Main Goals #

1. Make a world in which creatures can move around separately from each other. 
2. Add parameters to substitute for natural selection.
3. Pass on traits from creatures following the set parameters to the new generation.
4. Evolution!

### Other Goals #

* Create different species of creatures.
* Allow for the extinction and creation of species.
* Export the brain data to a visual representation such as a slideshow.

### Requirements #
- [ ] Each creature must have its own brain.
- [ ] Each creature must have its own genes.
- [ ] New creatures must derive their genes from 2 creatures of the previous generation.
- [ ] A user must be able to see the generations play out.
